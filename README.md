Flower Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the species of flowers based on their physical attributes such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The goal is to build an efficient model that can classify flowers into various species based on these features.

Project Overview:
Data: The dataset used contains different flower species and their respective measurements, such as Iris species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica).
Algorithms: Implemented classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict the flower species.
Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.
Model Evaluation: Utilized accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
Libraries Used: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Key Features:
Predict flower species based on key attributes.
Built using various machine learning models for comparison.
Visualizations of data distributions and model performance metrics.
